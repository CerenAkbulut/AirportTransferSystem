                        <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in
                            America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank
                            or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino
                            networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight,
                            online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government.
                            But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos
                            started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer
                            of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting
                            electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me.
                            Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that
                            wish to play in online casinos.</p>
